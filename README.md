# Vehicle Noise Prediction: Speed Bump Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jitender2622/Vehicle-Noise-Prediction/blob/main/speed_bump_noise_data.ipynb)

This project utilizes Machine Learning to predict the noise levels (in decibels) generated by vehicles passing over speed bumps. By analyzing the physical dimensions of the speed bump and the speed of the vehicle, the model provides an estimation of noise pollution, which is crucial for urban planning and traffic management.

## 📄 Project Overview

Speed bumps are essential for traffic calming, but they often contribute to noise pollution. This project aims to model the relationship between speed bump geometry, vehicle dynamics, and acoustic output.

The notebook explores two different regression approaches:
1.  **Linear Regression:** For establishing a baseline linear relationship.
2.  **Random Forest Regressor:** For capturing non-linear relationships and improving prediction accuracy.

## 💾 Data Description

The model relies on a dataset (e.g., `speed_bump_noise_data.csv`) containing the following features:

| Feature | Unit | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Length_m** | Meters | The longitudinal length of the speed bump. |
| **Width_m** | Meters | The width of the speed bump across the road. |
| **Height_m** | Meters | The vertical height of the speed bump. |
| **Vehicle_Speed_kmph** | km/h | The speed of the vehicle passing over the bump. |
| **Noise_dB** | Decibels | **(Target)** The recorded noise level. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and ingestion.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-Learn:** For data scaling, model training, and evaluation.
* **Google Colab:** For cloud-based execution.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The project follows a standard Data Science pipeline:

1.  **Data Loading:** Uploads and reads the CSV file. *Note: The code includes a fallback to generate dummy data if the CSV is not found.*
2.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Feature selection (`Length`, `Width`, `Height`, `Speed`).
    * Data scaling using `StandardScaler` to normalize feature magnitudes.
3.  **Model Training:**
    * Splits data into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) sets.
    * Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** (100 estimators).
4.  **Evaluation:**
    * Calculates **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score** to validate performance.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this README.
1.  Run the first cell to initialize the environment.
2.  When prompted, upload your `speed_bump_noise_data.csv` file.
3.  Run the subsequent cells to train the model and see predictions.

### Option 2: Local Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jitender2622/Vehicle-Noise-Prediction.git](https://github.com/jitender2622/Vehicle-Noise-Prediction.git)
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
3.  Ensure your data file is named `speed_bump_noise_data.csv` and is in the same directory.
4.  Run the script or notebook.

## 📊 Sample Results

Based on the model evaluation in the notebook, typical performance metrics are:

* **R² Score:** ~0.85 (Indicates the model explains 85% of the variance in noise levels).
* **Mean Squared Error:** ~10.02

*Example Prediction:*
For a speed bump with:
* Length: 3m
* Width: 0.8m
* Height: 0.075m
* Vehicle Speed: 20 km/h

**Predicted Noise:** ~69.46 dB
